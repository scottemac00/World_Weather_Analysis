# World_Weather_Analysis
## Purpose 
- The purpose of this project was to collect and present data for customers via a notional search page, which they would be able to filter based on specific (preferred) travel criteria in order to find their ideal hotel, anywhere in the world.
## Analysis
- Part of this analysis entailed performing statistical calculations on real-time weather data using linear regression on parameters in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. This data can help teams predict the best time of year for people to plan their vacation (if a major factor in their planning is weather).
- Analysis of locations in [WeatherPy.ipynb](https://github.com/scottemac00/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/6a6c5e5d51a2df779ca48af239a6edfa7dbc4a60/WeatherPy.ipynb)
## Summary Results
- The data was exported, assessed, cleaned, and used to identify the best cities for vacation based on specific temperature criteria, and then mapping these cities using Jupyter and the Google Places API. Correlations between latitude and temperature and humidity were noted, with cloud cover proving not to be a sufficient factor based on a city's geographic location.
