# World_Weather_Analysis
- Collect and present data for customers via the search page, which they will then filter based on their preferred travel criteria in order to find their ideal hotel, anywhere in the world.
- Part of this analysis entails performing statistical calculations on the data using linear regression on the weather parameters in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. This data will help my team predict the best time of year for people to plan their vacation. 
- Final action will be exporting the data, cleaning it, and using the weather data to choose the best cities for vacation based on specific criteria, and then mapping these cities using Jupyter and the Google Places API.
